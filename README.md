# Statistical-Arbitrage-Engine-Cointegration-Kalman-Filter
Statistical Arbitrage Engine Using Cointegration & Kalman Filter

• Developed statistical arbitrage engine using Engle-Granger cointegration and dynamic spread modeling on French equities; implemented signal generation, cost-adjusted backtesting, and risk-controlled execution framework.

This is:

* Mean reversion modeling

* Pair trading

* Cointegration testing

* Kalman dynamic hedge ratio

* Z-score signal engine

* Risk management system

* Out-of-sample validation

* Transaction cost modeling
